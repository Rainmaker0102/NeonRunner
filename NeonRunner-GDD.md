## Synposis
Neon Japan Runner is a game that plays like *Super Mario Bros* and looks like if *Tron* took place in Japan with a Sakura pink skin. Stylized computer-themed cities taken over by enemies reminiscent of computer malware define the landscape of the game.

## Level Design Philosophy
The level design philosophy should encourage the player for being resourceful with their moveset while also encourange exploration. Encouraging exploration, however, does **not** mean banging their heads against a wall or jumping randomly hoping for an invisible power up. Secrets should have something distinct about them (no matter how small that distinct marker is). See *Doom (1993)* for more about what secrets in a level should look like.
