# Playtest 0.1.0 Questionnaire
Hello! If you're reading this, then that means you're a G.

No seriously, thanks for helping me with the playtest! Short & simple for the first one, just a four questions.

# Questions
1. What did you like or not like about the way the player controls? Were they easy to understand and fun to manipulate?
2. What did you like or not like about the background and/or tileset?
3. Seeing the game prototype and reading the title "Neon Runner", what kind of plot or story would you like to see in a game like this?
4. Are there any other comments, questions, or concerns you'd like to leave?
